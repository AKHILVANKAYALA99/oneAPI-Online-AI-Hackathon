# Water Quality Predictor

## Project Title: "Water Quality Predictor: A Machine Learning Driven Solution for Safe Drinking Water"

### Description:

The project addresses the critical issue of predicting water quality, with a specific focus on its suitability for consumption. Given that only 3% of the Earth's total water volume is freshwater, ensuring access to safe and sanitary water is essential for both human existence and the preservation of surrounding ecosystems. This project aims to provide a solution that accurately predicts water safety.

### Proposed Solution:

We propose the development of a Water Quality Predictor utilizing the oneAPI daal4py library and sklearnx Patches which are used for optimization of Machine Learning algorithms. By harnessing the capabilities of IntelÂ® oneAPI, we will construct a Random Forest Classifier Model. This approach will significantly enhance the accuracy of water safety predictions.

### Impact:

The impact of this solution on human lives and environments is substantial. Accurately assessing water quality empowers individuals to make informed decisions about water consumption, leading to improved public health and environmental conservation efforts.

### Target Audience:

The target audience for this project includes:

- Individuals seeking to assess the safety of their drinking water at home.
- Communities and local authorities responsible for managing public water supplies.
- Environmental agencies focused on water quality monitoring and protection.
